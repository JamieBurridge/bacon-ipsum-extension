# Bacon Ipsum Extension
Browser extension to generate dummy data using the [Bacon Ipsum API](https://baconipsum.com/json-api/)

Simply input the number of sentences you wish to retrieve and they will be automatically copied to the clipboard.

### Installation
I have not yet uploaded this extension to the web store.

If you would like to use it simple **clone the repository.**

```
git clone https://github.com/JamieBurridge/bacon-ipsum-extension.git
```

Then go to the **extensions** page on your browser, enable developer mode and **upload the cloned folder.**
